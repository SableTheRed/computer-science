        <p>
            Most probably won't care, but it's useful for me.

        <h3> The First Step </h3>
        <p> After a solid year of consideration, and around 6 months of asking, I finally had the support and funds to join the gym. On the 17th of January, I take a parent and sign my soul away to the world of fitness.</p>

        <h3> A False Start </h3>
        <p> I signed up, but none of the gym staff were around to book an induction for me. I understood that I was to hae an induction that very Thursday, but when I turned up there were no slots available. I was booked for the following Thursday instead.</p>

        <h3> The Induction </h3>
        <p>On Thursday 26th January, I had my induction. Since that point, I was allowed to enter and use the gym whenever my membership permitted. I was also qualified to use all machines in the general area. I began a habit of attempting to go 2 times a week minimum, though more recently this goal has progressed to 3 times per week.</p>

        <h3> Progression </h3>
        <p> On Thursday the 2nd of march I took my freeweights induction, where I learned (and promptly forgot) the correct form for squats, deadlifts, and horizontal bench.
            <br>
            I haven't set a PR for squat yet, but for deadlift the most I have lifted is 50kg, and for bench I have a one-rep max of 30kg. Obviously this all needs improving by quite a stretch.
